Hello, thanks for checking out my work in progress Spaceship game.

This is built using the Processing library (in the Processing IDE) which can be found here: https://processing.org/
Processing is a really simple and straightforward library that makes building a functioning Java Applet quick and easy.

== The game concept ==

Right now, I'm playing around with a simple little game where you have to build up and sustain a colony on a spaceship.

Features to Develop:

- Oxygen/Air simulation.
- Population growth/decline.
- Ship expansion (adding rooms)
- Energy system
- Finite resources for sustaining populations
- Random events/Encounters
- Heat/thermals simulation

== How to edit ==

Use the preferred text editor of choice, however opening the "SpaceShip.pde" in the Processing editor
is probably going to be the easiest way to edit and test the code.
